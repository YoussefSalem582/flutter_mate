### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review of code completed
- [ ] Comments added for complex code
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines:

- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variables, functions, and parameters
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and types
- Use `lowercase_with_underscores` for file names
- Maximum line length: 80 characters (flexible for readability)
- Use trailing commas for better formatting

### Code Organization

- **One class per file** (unless nested classes)
- **Organize imports:** dart imports, package imports, relative imports
- **Use const constructors** where possible
- **Avoid deep nesting** (max 3-4 levels)

### Widget Guidelines

- **Use GetView** for widgets that need controller access
- **Extract reusable widgets** into separate files
- **Use Obx** for reactive updates
- **Add animations** using flutter_animate

### Example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animate/flutter_animate.dart';

class ExamplePage extends GetView<ExampleController> {
  const ExamplePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Example')),
      body: Obx(() => _buildContent()),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildContent() {
    return Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
      child: Text(controller.someValue.value),
    ).animate().fadeIn();
  }
}
```

## Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat(lessons): add video tutorial support

Add ability to embed video tutorials in lesson detail pages
with progress tracking and playback controls.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(progress): correct XP calculation

XP points were being calculated incorrectly when lessons
were completed out of order. Fixed calculation to use
actual completion count.
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Update tests when modifying existing code
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### Test Structure

```dart
void main() {
  group('FeatureName', () {
    testWidgets('should do something', (tester) async {
      // Arrange
      await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
      
      // Act
      await tester.tap(find.byType(ElevatedButton));
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
      
      // Assert
      expect(find.text('Expected Result'), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });
}
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update technical docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) for structural changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs with dartdoc comments

### Dartdoc Example

```dart
/// Calculates the overall progress percentage.
///
/// Returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing
/// the completion percentage across all stages.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final progress = controller.calculateProgress();
/// print('Progress: ${progress * 100}%');
/// ```
double calculateProgress() {
  // Implementation
}
```
