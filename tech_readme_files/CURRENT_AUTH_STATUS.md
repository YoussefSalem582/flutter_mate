If you want to test without Google Sign-In, you can temporarily comment it out:

In your Login/SignUp pages, wrap the Google button with a comment:
```dart
// Temporarily disabled until Google Sign-In is enabled in Firebase
/*
SocialLoginButton(
  onPressed: () => authController.signInWithGoogle(),
  icon: Icons.g_mobiledata_rounded,
  label: 'Continue with Google',
  backgroundColor: isDark ? Colors.white : Colors.white,
  textColor: Colors.black87,

## 🐛 If You See Errors

### "Google Sign-In failed"
**This is expected!** Google Sign-In is not enabled yet.
**Solutions:**
1. Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase Console (see above)
2. OR temporarily hide the Google Sign-In button

### "Firebase not initialized"
**Solution:** Make sure your `main.dart` has:
```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

### Email not sending
**Check:**
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates
2. Make sure templates are enabled
3. Check spam folder
4. Verify email in Firebase Console settings
