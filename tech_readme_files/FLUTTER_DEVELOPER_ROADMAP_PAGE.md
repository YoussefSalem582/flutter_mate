- **Data models** for type safety (RoadmapSkill, CareerPath, LearningTip)

### Dependencies Used
- `flutter/material.dart` - Material Design widgets
- `flutter_mate/core/constants/app_colors.dart` - App color palette
- `flutter_mate/core/utils/responsive_utils.dart` - Responsive layout utilities
- `flutter_mate/shared/widgets/app_bar_widget.dart` - Consistent app bar

### Key Code Patterns
```dart
// Stage building pattern
_buildRoadmapStage(
  context,
  isDark,
  isDesktop,
  stage: 1,
  title: 'Foundation',
  subtitle: '0-2 Months',
  description: '...',
  gradient: LinearGradient(...),
  icon: Icons.foundation,
  skills: [...],
  resources: [...],
)
```

## Customization

### Adding New Stages
To add additional stages, simply call `_buildRoadmapStage` with new parameters:

```dart

  context,
  isDark,
  isDesktop,
  stage: 6,
  title: 'New Stage',
  subtitle: 'Duration',
  description: 'Description',
  gradient: LinearGradient(colors: [color1, color2]),
  icon: Icons.your_icon,
  skills: [
    RoadmapSkill(title: 'Category', items: ['skill1', 'skill2']),
  ],
  resources: ['Resource 1', 'Resource 2'],
)
```
