# ✅ App Routes Updated

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Added Authentication Routes** (`lib/core/routes/app_routes.dart`)
```dart
// New authentication routes
static const String login = '/login';
static const String signup = '/signup';
static const String forgotPassword = '/forgot-password';
static const String emailVerification = '/email-verification';
```

### 2. **Updated Route Pages** (`lib/core/routes/app_pages.dart`)
Added 4 new authentication pages to the routes:
- **Login Page** - Email/password login + Google + Guest mode
- **Sign Up Page** - New user registration
- **Forgot Password Page** - Password reset
- **Email Verification Page** - Auto-checking verification status

All with smooth page transitions!

### 3. **Firebase Initialization** (`lib/main.dart`)
```dart
// Initialize Firebase
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);

// Initialize Authentication Controller
Get.put(AuthController());
```

### 4. **Smart Navigation** (`lib/features/onboarding/pages/splash_page.dart`)
The splash page now intelligently routes users:
```dart
if (!hasSeenOnboarding) {
  // First time → Onboarding
  Go to: Onboarding Page
} else if (authenticated) {
  // Logged in → Home
  Go to: Roadmap (Home)
} else {
  // Seen onboarding but not logged in → Login
  Go to: Login Page
}
```

### 5. **Onboarding Completion** (`lib/features/onboarding/pages/onboarding_page.dart`)
After completing onboarding:
- Marks onboarding as seen (won't show again)
- Navigates to Login page
- User can then sign up or sign in

### 6. **Auth Middleware** (`lib/core/routes/auth_middleware.dart`) ⭐ NEW FILE
Created middleware for protecting routes (ready to use when needed):
- **AuthMiddleware** - Redirects to login if not authenticated
- **GuestMiddleware** - Redirects to home if already authenticated

---

## 🚀 Complete Flow

### First Time User:
```
1. App Launch → Splash (2.5s)
2. No onboarding seen → Onboarding Page
3. Complete onboarding → Login Page
4. Sign Up → Email Verification
5. Verify email → Roadmap (Home) ✅
```

### Returning User (Not Logged In):
```
1. App Launch → Splash (2.5s)
2. Onboarding seen + Not authenticated → Login Page
3. Sign In → Roadmap (Home) ✅
```

### Returning User (Logged In):
```
1. App Launch → Splash (2.5s)
2. Authenticated → Roadmap (Home) ✅
```

### Guest Mode:
```
1. Login Page → Click "Continue as Guest"
2. Creates anonymous Firebase user
3. → Roadmap (Home) ✅
```

## 📱 Available Navigation Routes

### Public Routes (No Auth Required):
- `/splash` - Splash screen
- `/onboarding` - Onboarding carousel
- `/login` - Login page
- `/signup` - Sign up page
- `/forgot-password` - Password reset

### Protected Routes (Auth Required):
- `/email-verification` - Verify email
- `/roadmap` - Home page
- `/progress-tracker` - Track progress
- `/assistant` - AI assistant
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/achievements` - Badges & achievements
- `/code-playground` - Code editor
- `/lessons` - Lesson list
- `/lesson-detail` - Lesson details
- `/quiz` - Quiz page

---

## 🔐 Using Auth Middleware (Optional)

To protect routes with authentication, add middleware to any route:

```dart
GetPage(
  name: AppRoutes.profile,
  page: () => const ProfilePage(),
  middlewares: [AuthMiddleware()], // ← Protects this route
),
```

To prevent logged-in users from accessing login/signup:

```dart
GetPage(
  name: AppRoutes.login,
  page: () => const LoginPage(),
  middlewares: [GuestMiddleware()], // ← Redirects if authenticated
),
```

---

## ✅ What Works Now

### Navigation:
- ✅ Splash → Onboarding → Login flow
- ✅ Splash → Login (if onboarding seen)
- ✅ Splash → Home (if authenticated)
- ✅ Login → Sign Up → Email Verification
- ✅ Login → Forgot Password
- ✅ Guest Mode → Home

### Authentication:
- ✅ Email/Password sign up
- ✅ Email verification
- ✅ Email/Password sign in
- ✅ Anonymous (Guest) sign in
- ✅ Password reset
- ✅ Sign out
- ⚠️ Google Sign-In (not enabled in Firebase Console yet)

### State Management:
- ✅ AuthController tracks login state
- ✅ Reactive navigation based on auth status
- ✅ Onboarding completion persisted
- ✅ Auto-login on app restart

## 🎯 Testing the Flow

### Test 1: Fresh Install
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Expected:**
1. Splash screen (2.5s)
2. Onboarding page
3. Complete onboarding
4. **Login page appears** ✅

### Test 2: Sign Up
1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Enter username, email, password
3. Submit
4. **Email Verification page** ✅
5. Check email for verification link
6. Click link
7. Return to app
8. Click "I've Verified"
9. **Navigate to Home** ✅

### Test 3: Guest Mode
1. On Login page
2. Click "Continue as Guest"
3. **Navigate to Home** ✅
4. No email required!

### Test 4: Restart App (Logged In)
1. Close and reopen app
2. Splash screen (2.5s)
3. **Direct to Home** ✅
4. No login required!

### Test 5: Sign Out
1. Sign out from app
2. Restart app
3. Splash screen (2.5s)
4. **Back to Login page** ✅

## 🔄 Next Steps

Now that routing is complete:

1. **Create Firestore Database** (see `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md`)
2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Sign up with email
   - Email verification
   - Sign in
   - Guest mode
3. **Optional: Enable Google Sign-In** (see `CURRENT_AUTH_STATUS.md`)
4. **Build User Profile Page**
5. **Add Analytics Dashboard**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not initialized"
- Make sure you ran `flutter pub get` after adding Firebase
- Check that `firebase_options.dart` exists

### "Can't navigate to login"
- Verify all auth pages are imported in `app_pages.dart`
- Check that route names match in `app_routes.dart`

### "Stuck on splash screen"
- Check console for errors
- Make sure AuthController is initialized in main.dart
- Verify SharedPreferences is initialized

### "Onboarding shows every time"
- Check that `hasSeenOnboarding` is being set
- Verify SharedPreferences permissions
