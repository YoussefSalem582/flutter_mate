## 💡 Tips for Development

### Working with GetX:
```dart
// Navigate to a screen
Get.toNamed(AppRoutes.profile);

// Navigate and remove previous screen
Get.offNamed(AppRoutes.roadmap);

// Navigate and clear stack
Get.offAllNamed(AppRoutes.splash);

// Access theme manager
final themeManager = Get.find<ThemeManager>();
```

### Adding New Features:
1. Create feature folder in `lib/features/`
2. Add presentation, controller, data layers
3. Register route in `app_routes.dart`
4. Add GetPage in `app_pages.dart`
5. Update bottom nav if needed

### Testing:
- Widget tests are set up in `test/widget_test.dart`
- Add more tests as features grow
- Use GetX test utilities for controller tests
